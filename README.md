Hello, I'm just a hard-to-motivated latin american pixelated monkey who's into competitive typing. So:
- I'm a JVM enthusiast and a fan of Object Oriented programming. My favorite languages are Java and Kotlin.
- Taught myself how to program as a hobby.
- Mainly develop Minecraft mods but I am also trying to branch out into other types of projects.
- Native language is Spanish, but extremely fluent in English.
- Somewhat familiar with Python and C. Would like to get into embedded programming in the future.
- Interested in learning languages like C#, Scala and Clojure in the future.
